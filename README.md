# DataLake-Tracker-HDFS
This repository tries to focus on building a DataLake with HDFS, including Data Cutoff and Lineage tracking.


The main focus here is to make it easier for you to create and manage a powerful data lake on HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). With this project, you'll have all the essential tools at your disposal to handle data cutoff and track lineage.

## 3 Main Concepts of this Repository:

+ Powerful DataLake using HDFS

You can easily write files on Hadoop and transform it into a powerful data lake. Here I show you how you can unlock the full potential of your data management and analysis using HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).

+ Data Cutoff Management

It gives you a clear picture of the data's freshness up to very moment if you know when data is updated . Here I try to make sure the DataLake is always up-to-date and ready for any analysis or insights you need

+ Data Lineage Tracking

I tried to create powerful lineage tracking features within which you can trace the origin and transformation of your data. This provides you with valuable insights for monitoring and analyzing the data's lineage.
